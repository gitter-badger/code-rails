Add the theme's files to the appropriate places in the Rails file hierarchy.<br>
Read again if needed:<br>
[The Rails Asset Pipeline Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html), especially section 2.1.

Remember, "assets" are the css, js, image, etc. files your site uses.
The theme you selected should simply have html/css/js/images that you need to extract from the theme and add to your Rails app. Copy/paste is ok here!<br>
Some things belong in `app/assets` and others in `vendor/assets` - what is the difference?
