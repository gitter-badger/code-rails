# Watch this!

Get out the popcorn, it's movie time!

1. Ryan Davis, the creator of Minitest, gives an overview with [Minitest Insights with Ryan Davis](http://vimeo.com/75833835).
1. Optional: RailsCast on [MiniTest with Rails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/327-minitest-with-rails?view=asciicast) (16m).
  - Note: This video is pretty old.
  - It uses outdated versions of Rails and Minitest.
  - Don't try to code along with it, just sit back and enjoy.
  - Don't pay too much attention to how Ryan sets up Minitest, but watch more generally how he creates a Rails app, and uses a few different kinds of testing.
  - There are a few good hints towards the end.

Ok, let's give it a try!
