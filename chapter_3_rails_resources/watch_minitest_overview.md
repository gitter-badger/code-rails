# Watch: Minitest Overview and RailsCast on Minitest with Rails

- Ryan Davis, the creator of Minitest, gives an overview [Minitest Insights with Ryan Davis](http://vimeo.com/75833835)

**Optional:**

Watch [RailsCast on MiniTest with Rails(http://railscasts.com/episodes/327-minitest-with-rails?view=asciicast) (16m).

Note: That video is pretty old, and uses outdated versions of Rails and Minitest. Don't pay too much attention to how Ryan sets up Minitest, but watch more generally how he creates a Rails app, and uses a few different kinds of testing. There are a few good hints towards the end.
