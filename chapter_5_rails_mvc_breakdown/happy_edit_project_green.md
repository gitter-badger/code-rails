## GREEN: Code and run the spec often!

Keep running the spec and resolving errors until it works! Remember, you can run just this one test with the following command from our project root:

    $ ruby -Itest test/features/projects/editing_a_project_test.rb

note: That is a "dash with capital i" (a bash option) to the ruby command

What's the output?
