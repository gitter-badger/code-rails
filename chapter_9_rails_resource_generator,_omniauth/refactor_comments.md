### REFACTOR: Comments
Actually, don't refactor just yet. The client just called in some additional requirements. "Just a quick thing," they said. Wouldn't it be faster for commenter to sign up if they could use their Twitter accounts?

BDD an OAuth login:
- Site Visitors can only comment if they log in with Twitter (and/or optionally Facebook or LinkedIn)

- What value should go in the new user's `role` column?

- Authors and Editors can still comment, too
